AGI Jobs

A clean AI Jobboard

Use KVDB

User can:
- See all jobs (use the list keys command `curl https://kvdb.io/N7cmQg1DwZbADh2Hu3NncF/     -u 'legal:'`, then get each resource one by one)
- Upload resource (using post to kvdb), triggering a modal, 

Each resource has a title, description, and URL

Make it clean and nice
